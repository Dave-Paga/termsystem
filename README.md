# T.E.R.M. (Ticketing Expert Repair Maintenance) System for Small and Midsized Auto Shop Businesses
# T.E.R.M. System Description

The Term System is prototype of an Auto Shop System with a ticketing with Scheduling System
and a Repair Diagnostics with an Expert.

## Ticketing with Scheduling System

When a customer visits the website, they would have an option to issue a ticket for the auto shop. This ticket will either be for a vehicle repair complete with all the important information from the customer and their vehicle. They could also have the option for the maintenance of their vehicle. After the customer had chosen the service that they wanted, they could schedule an available appointment from the auto shop and a ticket will be given to both the auto shop and the customer.


## Repair Diagnostics with an Expert Systems

The repair diagnostics will be done from an expert system that will be available on the website. The customer will have to answer a set of questions concerning the various problems that their vehicle currently has. The system would give out possible problems and solutions based on the answers the customer has given. The system would derive from a knowledge base that has rules built upon it to influence the results of the system. These rules would be derived from an expert’s advice of problems and solutions on the vehicle. After the customer is done with the inferring process and has gotten the results, they would have the option to create a ticket and schedule an appointment with the auto shop.

## System Requirements

The functionalities or system requirements come in two major parts: Repair diagnostics with an expert system and ticketing system with the scheduling system. The repair diagnostics will be done with an expert system that would give out possible solutions based on the answers of the customers about the problems regarding their vehicle and also an estimation of the repair cost. At the end of this process, they would have an option to create a ticket and also schedule a repair. The ticketing system with a scheduling system would let the customer choose to get repair or maintenance. This system would also let the customers schedule an appointment from the auto shop.

## Design Thinking Methodology

Our project utilizes the Design Thinking Methodology for data collection and analysis, this will be followed by prototyping, development and testing. The Design Thinking Methodology will be composed of five stages, which are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototyping, and Testing. 

## User Matrix

The admin, also known as the administrator, front desk or the cashier of the auto shop, has access to all functionalities. The admin can view and edit service requests, make tickets, edit staff schedules, check repair history, edit and view service progress.
The mechanic is capable of viewing and editing service requests, can make tickets, can edit the staff schedules, check repair history, edit and view service progress.
Finally, the customer is capable of making tickets, checking his or her repair history, and viewing the service progress. 

## Prototyping

The proposed system’s site map below starts with the user upon arriving at the home page, the user is presented with selecting either “diagnose vehicle”, “services”, “how’s my vehicle”, and “login/signup”. The user can go back to the home page from any of the four. If the user selects “diagnose vehicle”, the user could see the potential problems and is given the option to book a schedule. A user can also book a schedule from the services. Upon selecting “book a schedule”, the user can see his or her assigned ticket. Upon selecting “how’s my vehicle?”, the user can inquire about the current progress, and see the assigned ticket as well. If the user opted for “login/signup”, the user is given the chance to create an account or log in as either a member of the staff or a customer. Upon logging in as a staff member, the user can check repair tickets and set an available schedule. Upon logging in as a customer, one can see his or her repair history in the auto shop.
